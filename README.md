# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project
Focus on setting up and using Python Language, Pandas Library, and Jupyter Environment. Get familiar with the new School District dataset and perform some basic analysis.

## Resources
Data Source: new_full_student_data.csv 
Software: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas 

## Results
The analysis of the School District shows that:
- Reading Score for all schools and grades analysis:
    - Avg: 72.4
    - Min: 10.5
    - Max:  100
- Math Score for all schools and grades analysis:
    - Avg: 64.7
    - Min:  3.7
    - Max:  100
- Average School Budget by School Type:
    - Charter: $872,626
    - Public:  $911,196
- Average Math Score by School Type and Grade:
    - Charter Schools:
        - 9th  Grade: 70
        - 10th Grade: 66
        - 11th Grade: 68
        - 12th Grade: 60
    - Public Schools:
        - 9th  Grade: 64
        - 10th Grade: 64
        - 11th Grade: 59
        - 12th Grade: 64

## Summary
The analysis performed showed a couple noteworthy datapoints. We can use the Mean values from Deliverable 3 - Requirement 1 as a Math Score baseline to determine performance between school types. 
1. The school average budget between charter and public school was minimal (~5%).
2. Charter school's average math score was higher than the baseline for grades 9-11, but lower than baseline for grade 12.
3. Public school's average math score was around the baseline for grades 9, 10, 12, but lower than baseline for grade 11.
